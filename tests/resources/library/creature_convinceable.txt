Ordinary Fish dwell in many lakes, ponds and of course Tibia's seas. They can be caught with a fishing rod or, once the ability of exploring the underwater worlds of Tibia has been acquired, be observed in their natural environment.</p> <p>Fish have 25 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and physical damage. It takes 0 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Fish yield 0 experience points. They carry nothing with them.</p> </div></div> </div>
